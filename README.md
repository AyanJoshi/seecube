Project Description:

Our aim in this project would be to develop a Web App specifically for ASU students majoring in computer science, to provide them with resources that will help polish their programming skills and logical inferences. In addition, it will help them prepare for Job interviews, which are usually based on live programming.

There will be two types of users in our website:
    1) Students: They will be able to view practice questions tailored from the classes they've taken at ASU. The styling will be similar to Facebook's Hacker Cup code submissions, wherein the students are given an input file for every question and they will generate the output file and upload it on the website page. In the backend, the output files will be matched and the result will be displayed (accepted/rejected). 
    2) Recruiters: The recruiters will be able to view each student's profile for potential recruiting opportunities. They will be allowed to post their own job postings (once verified), which would include a redirect link to their career pages. 

Important Notes:

- Professors play a huge role in every student's journey and hence we decided to allow them to post their own questions (could be related to their courses), which could potentially be also counted as a homework activity.
- Students will be able to showcase their own projects on their profile (similar to hackster.io), which will give the recruiters an idea of the student's interests and hence lead to potential recruitment opportunities.
- ASU CIDSE Labs can also post research opportunities on the same page as job postings.

Although this Web App, only targets ASU students, there is potential to expand this to other universities.

Below are the list of expected deliverables:

Web App Design Overview (How the website will look):

Need to create following pages : 
SignUp/SignIn Authentication
Create a Landing Page(Tracks) - cards list view 
List questions page - card list view 
Question detail page : 
         1 ) card view , with a question and a description 
         2 ) submissions page 
         3 ) discuss and commenting section 
question submission 

Below we've listed possible features in our Web App that would enhance the student experience and hopefully make them fall in love with programming.

Important - 1 ) blog post feature 
                     2 ) 1 V 1 competition 
                     3)  Possibly SODA and WICS might be able to host their hackathons on 
                           our Web App.
                     4) Assigning Levels/Ranks/Badges to individual profiles based on the                                           
                          number of questions they solve.
